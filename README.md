# Baby Maze Hunt

Open `index.html` in your web browser to start the game. Click anywhere inside the grid to move the baby toward that point. When the baby touches the food, it grows and speeds up. If time runs out, the game ends and the "Start New Game" button appears. Click the button to restart and play again.
